![mnr_cayo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Monarch-Development/.github/refs/heads/main/release_images/mnr_cayo.png)

After years of missing an updated and optimized resource for this category, I present Monarch Cayo, an IPL loader that loads only the IPLs needed for the Cayo Perico island.

## FEATURES
- ✅ **Standalone script:** no dependencies required.
- 🚀 **Ultra optimized:** 0.00ms and only ~250KiB (best Cayo Perico script performance).
- 🌴 **One-time loading:** the IPLs are loaded once during player login.
- ❌ **No bloatware:** all unnecessary IPLs aren’t loaded.
- 🌊 **Water and paths:** dynamically loads water and paths with an optimized coords check.
- 🔄️ **Restart/Stop friendly:** no 3D assets in the resource and unload system to let you restart/stop the script without crashes.
- 🗺️ **Custom ymaps:** edited vanilla ymaps to make mansion gates and doors openable.
- 🚗 **Optional preset:** removed all car generators (link below).
